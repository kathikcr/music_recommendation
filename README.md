Flutter SDK: Version 3.5.2 or later is required. Follow the Flutter installation guide to set up Flutter on your machine. Be sure to add Flutter to your system's PATH.
Dart SDK: Compatible with Flutter SDK 3.5.2. The Dart SDK is included with Flutter, so it will be installed alongside Flutter.
Appwrite Server (optional): Appwrite is used as the backend service for this project. If you plan to utilize Appwrite, set up an Appwrite server and configure your Appwrite credentials in the .env file (details below).
Steps to Install and Run MoodSync

flutter pub get

This will download and set up all required packages, such as appwrite, flutter_svg, and google_generative_ai.

3.Environment Setup

The MoodSync app uses environment variables to manage sensitive information (like API keys). To set these up:

GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_generative_ai_key

Refer to a provided .env.example file (if available) for guidance on all necessary keys and their formats.

Note: Be sure not to expose your .env file if pushing this code to a public repository.
